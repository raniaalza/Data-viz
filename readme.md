# (Prosper Loan Data)
## by (Rania Alzahrani)


## Dataset

> This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.
For the wrangling process I have selected only 12 colunms to perform the analysis on.


## Summary of Findings

> In the exploratory analysis I looked into the borrower ARP and I found the distribution is right sekwed. I have divided the borrower ARP into low, medium and heigh using .discribe() to see the max and 25% and 75% percent. After dividing the ARP found that most of them are medium and when I looked into the relationship between the ARP range and the employment status found that is the most are associated with medium ARP. 




## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the Presentation I focus on the ARP, first I show the disturibution, then the ARP range with employment status. Finally, I look at the relationship between the three vairables loan original amount, monthly loan payment based on the employment status. 
I made sure that the plots are appropriate and use good encoding and good colors.
